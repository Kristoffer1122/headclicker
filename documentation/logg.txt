jobbet med spillet, lagde en area for spilleren, lagde kamera og bevegeslsesystem samt med at jeg jobber med random enemys.

Tirsdag 13/5/25
jobbet med header filer og la in våpen modellen og fikset at den følger kameraet imens man er i bevegelse https://search.brave.com/search?q=raylib+how+to+make+model+point+towards+camera+targer&source=desktop&summary=1&conversation=a09f2fdf96867fd349b80a
ryddet ogsaa opp i main filen, jobbet med aa putte forsjellige deler i egene filer for ryddigere kode.

fixed shooting by adding a function that sends a bullet flying only on the x axis, leading to the player not being able to shoot up or down,
bullet flies towards crosshair but the bullet takes too long to reach the crosshair.

made reloading possible with a function that resets the bullet to the end of the guns barrel everytime mouse button 1 is released or the player presses R,
added a enemy to the map, does nothing yet.

Worked on making the gun face towards the camera target, couldnt make it work but learned alot about vectors and how they behave, changed the bullet so it moves towards the camera target, also didnt work but got the bullet to start at the camera target.

fixed the gun not changing pitch, but now it doesnt change its yaw, need to use trigonometry to figure out the angle.

Finally fixed the gun, its kinda wonkey but works.
had to add theta to the mix and calculate the angle we were away from the x, y, z, vectors
// fixed it with reversing the pitch when yaw < 0

Onsdag 21/5/25
Actually fixed the gun this time, had to include a header file that helps with matrix work,

Torsdag 22/5/25
With gun working now i made bullets and a shooting mechanic.
using a struct for the bullets like a class, with things like direction, speed, lifetime, and active bool. then a max of 100 bullets and functions like init_Bullet_Pool, spawn_Bullet, update_Bullets, draw_Bullets, fire_Weapon, check_Bullet_Collision (which i have to finish making).
finished the bullet system

Fredag 23/5/25
Added a pixel effect to the screen, making the game look a bit retro, and making sure the screen scales with resolution

Mandag 25/5/25
Started working with lua. just learning at this point

Tirsdag 26/5/25
added lua functionality to the game, made enemy bobble up and down with sin and delta time, going to add this to the weapon as well, to simulate breathing.

Onsdag 27/5/25
worked with lua and made some simple movements for the enemy

Mandag 2/6/25


Tirsdag 3/6/25

Onsdag 4/6/25
Worked with the bullet and enemy collision, added deltatime to the bullets speed, makes collision detection more reliable.
learned about extern's use in c, being able to use the same struct across files is so nice

						TODO:
	
	LUALUALUALUA

	SOUND EFFECTS!!!!!!!!!!!!
	make the gun lose bullets everytime you shoot, need to reload at 0 bullets
	big on the collision mechanic
	collision mechanic between player and wall, enemy and wall and bullets and wall/enemy
	a simple particle when the bullet hits something
	Enemies randomly spawning and taking damage, falling when dead

	some sort of memory leak going on?

	Lighting on the map, shaders
	Nice looking map

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
				    in the future

	Adding lights and another map, collision with the bullets and player.
	make the enemy move, and lose health when shot and die when at 0 health.
